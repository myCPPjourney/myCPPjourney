- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @myCPPjourney
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in c++
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning c++, I started learning about 2 weeks ago

Goal:
My goal is to become better at c++, its technically my 2nd programming language because my first was Javascript 
but I wasn't really consistent with it so I switched to c++ for the fun of it.

Everyday I'll try to document mini daily projects, the good, bad, and ugly codes.
